This is a final project from the online courses I attended. It's a site for purchasing train tickets that was made according to an already made design. Backend infrastructure for it was also provided in advance, and so my task consisted of developing frontend only.

## What features are available

1. Choice of departure and arrival cities and dates. The site will find trips according to your preferences;
2. Choice of train. If there are several of them available, you can also apply various filters to them;
3. Choice of vagon and seat;
4. Filling in passenger information;
5. Filling in payment information;
6. Subscription to news through the form in site footer.

## Important notes

1. This site is not adaptive;
2. It's main functionality consists of purchasing tickets. Therefore various interactive elements on the main page, such as the slider with user responses are not actually interative;
3. It does not hovewer apply to interactive elements on other pages. You can absolutely collapse and open different windows with informaton about the trip, add new passengers, give the service a rating at the final screen and so on.
